Store files on the cloud using hybrid cryptography without RSA, integrate with an Amazon S3 bucket, and use Firebase Authentication, follow these high-level steps:

1. Set Up Firebase Authentication:
Create a Firebase project and set up Firebase Authentication.
Enable email and password authentication, or any other authentication method suitable for your application.

2. Set Up Amazon S3:
Create an Amazon S3 bucket in your AWS account to store the encrypted files.
Configure the necessary permissions to control access to the S3 bucket. You may need to create IAM roles and policies.

3. Implement Hybrid Cryptography:
Choose a symmetric encryption algorithm like AES for file encryption.
Generate a random Data Encryption Key (DEK) for each file.
Encrypt the file using AES with the DEK.
Choose a key management system or use Firebase Realtime Database or Firestore to store and manage DEKs securely.

4. File Upload:
Create a file upload component in your React application.
When a user uploads a file, generate a DEK for that file.
Encrypt the file with AES using the DEK.
Store the encrypted file in the Amazon S3 bucket.
Store the DEK securely in Firebase or your chosen key management system.

5. File Download:
Create a file download component in your React application.
Retrieve the encrypted file from the S3 bucket.
Retrieve the DEK from Firebase or your key management system.
Decrypt the file using AES with the DEK.
Provide the decrypted file for download.

6. Access Control:
Implement access control logic in your application. You can use Firebase Authentication to manage user access.
Define who can upload, download, or delete files.
Ensure that only authorized users have access to the DEKs.

7. User Authentication:
Use Firebase Authentication to authenticate users.
Ensure that users have appropriate permissions to upload, download, and manage files.

8. Secure Your Application:
Implement secure coding practices to protect against common vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
Regularly update and patch dependencies.
Implement security rules and policies in Firebase and AWS to further enhance security.
